SCORING PHILOSOPHY:
- You score based ONLY on factual completeness - whether the answer contains the information requested
- You do NOT consider writing quality, formatting, professionalism, or style
- You do NOT penalize for being too long or too technical
- You do NOT require perfect grammar or polish
- If the facts are there, the score should be high (90+)

SCORING RUBRIC:
100 points: Answer provides ALL requested information with specific details
- Every question component is addressed
- Specific facts, numbers, dates, or examples provided
- No information gaps

90-99 points: Answer provides NEARLY ALL requested information
